With over 200 cities represented. these vegan groups continue to make a positive impact and are an essential resource for those looking to join the vegan community. The vegan movement has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. with more people than ever before choosing to adopt a vegan lifestyle.

The success of these vegan Facebook groups is a testament to the power of social media. and the impact it can have on the vegan movement. These groups have become a hub for vegan activists. providing a platform for them to share their stories. recipes. advice. and events. These groups have also been instrumental in helping to convert thousands of people to veganism.

A long drive along the coast. saying happy new year in the dark in the first minute of the new year etc etc ultimately anything that comes with a package of fun. Why Singles ? I just mentioned singles in the group welcome description because with my experience all married people they have less time for all these nonsense . kiddish activites . not just because they dont want to but they have other commitments to do.But if you are married and still feel the same thoughts to have fun and have time you are always welcome. Why Indians ? Because if it is generic than there will be huge numbers out there and there will not be enough time to have fun even if it is 24/7 then we may end up quiting our jobs :) Just that we might have lots in common to share no other intention. if you feel you also have lots in common with Indians and or interested to have more Indian friends and want to know more about them . you are most welcome to join the group. Who Should Join ? Those who dont have friends Those who have friends but want more friends Those who want to kill there time but not alone Those who like having fun all time Those who can get along in the group.

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

Business owners. please promote your business. Post your Facebook Page. website link. product or service info. and any deals or sales you have going on. Area Residents. if you are looking for a product or service please ask in this group! Someone may connect you to the right person offering that product or service. Tell your friends and neighbors about businesses. specials and products posted in the group. Why support local businesses and business owners? Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy. What most people don‚Äôt realize is that they provide over half of the jobs in this country. But there is a deeper reason as to why you. as a consumer. would want to support the small businesses within your community. When you spend your money to buy products and services from locally owned businesses. more of that money stays in the local economy. This means more money is available for schools. recreation. and other infrastructure that is important to your community. DISCLAIMER Group Admins.

Feel free to post photos of your items. a brief description. price and location or post about that special item you are trying to find at a bargain price. Happy selling! Here are a few ground rules.... 1. Please add a description of the item that includes your location. the condition. and your price. Your photo should show the true quality of your item. so that the buyer knows exactly what they are purchasing. It is also advisable that you make sure that your item is cleaned and looks presentable. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD ANY EXPIRED SAFETY ITEMS BE SOLD!!! This includes cribs and car seats. Children are our most precious resources and their safety is a most important concern! 2 Price your items fairly. It is a good idea to see what similar items are going for on the site. When in doubt. take half the retail value and use that as your starting point. 3. Generally. it is the buyer's responsibility to come to the seller to pick up the purchase. You can make other arrangements. 4. Please pick up all items in a timely manner. This is only fair to the seller. Likewise. sellers please be timely in contacting the buyer! The seller has the right to determine if a fair amount of time has passed before re-posting. 5. The buyer should make arrangements to pick up the items within a week. unless you and the seller have agreed on another time. 6. If an item has sold and has been picked up by the buyer. please DELETE the photo immediately! 7. It is only polite. and fair. to bump your items only once or twice a week. If your photo bumping becomes excessive. you will be asked to leave the group. 8. ABSOLUTELY. POSITIVELY NO SOLICITING! 9.This site is ONLY used for the sale. swap or giveaway of baby. toddler and children items. Any non-related items will be deleted and your membership may be revoked. You may contact me directly for possible exceptions. 10. Regarding second hand car seats. this is the recommendation from the MassGov website: Additional Note on Second Hand Seats : It is not recommended that you use a second hand seat. If you do have a second hand seat make sure you know the history of the seat. Do not use a seat that has been involved in a motor vehicle crash. Do not use a seat that is six or more years old. It is also very important you contact the manufacturer to check for possible recalls on the seat and register the seat so you will be notified of any future recalls. Again it is not recommended that you use any second hand seat! Go to http://www.mass.gov/eopss/crime-prev-personal-sfty/traffic-safety/cps/ for more information. 11.

Say hello and get to know our members so we can also get to know you! www.teamrwb.org/chapter/team-rwb-boston-ma Group Rules and Policies: Members should not advertise for other groups or businesses. There are exceptions to this rule. particularly when an organization is a committed partner or is a donor/supporter of this chapter. If it is a free opportunity that can be useful to many members. please share. For example. some of our members own local gyms or other businesses. These members often arrange events in their place of business for the benefit of our members. Team RWB is deeply appreciative of these partnerships and encourages sharing them so members can attend. Please do not post anything politically or socially divisive to the group. We are an apolitical organization that strives to be inclusive in nature and need to maintain that status in order to maximize our reach. If you find divisive content which you feel is inappropriate please notify an admin. Team RWB members should not post fundraising links for other groups or causes. Posts which directly ask for donations or directly sell things to fundraise for a non-RWB charity are not permitted. We appreciate your charity work and we understand that many of our members are often involved in other groups. However. at an organizational level we can not directly fundraise for those charities. The most common approach which is permitted here is to share an event you are hosting or involved in which itself may be a fundraising event. The key difference is that you are not asking for money but rather are inviting members to attend. even if it includes a cover cost. Please keep the frequency of such posts reasonable. Team RWB groups are not the place to transfer and give away race bibs. Team RWB has many partnerships and bib sharing often violates regulations and puts these partnerships in jeopardy. Even if you know that a particular race allows bib transfers. please refrain from openly posting about it within the group. You are encouraged to discuss the race itself. to include sharing or asking for information and directing members to official race organizers. However. any requests to send or receive a bib transfer must not be made in the group and should be discussed with the race organizers and privately between race participants. This is not the place to discuss the status or members' opinions of other organizations. Team RWB has many partnerships at the national and local level and negative posts have the ability to damage those partnerships. no matter how small. Team RWB is a positive. safe place and negative messages about other organizations may turn some members away. Content that is negative in nature (attacks on other members. defamatory statements. VA bashing. etc.) is not in alignment with our Eagle Ethos and has no place in our organization. If you find negative content which you feel is inappropriate please notify an admin.",NA,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

Post what kind of help you're looking for. or respond to a post made by a volunteer fosterer. Looking to help the community by fostering a pet that needs a temporary home while its owner recovers stability. and can you offer a stable home for their pet in the meantime? Post what kind of help you can give. or respond to a post made by someone looking for pet help. We recommend that pet fosterers and owners sign a contract between themselves before handing over the pet in order to ensure good communication. Here's a sample of a foster agreement to use or adapt! Please read over carefully: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiKlBPOJrLgHFo19PFFkirl-qupnT-RHStzqetPfVyA/edit Any admins and moderators of this group are not responsible for anything that happens to a fostered pet. or people or animals it interacts with. or destruction of property caused by a pet. Admins and moderators are not legally or personally responsible for enforcing the group rules. The most they can do is block someone from this Facebook group. Please keep this in mind before posting! -------- Before you post please read the rules: FOR PEOPLE SEEKING A FOSTERER If you're looking for foster help with your pet. inform any potential fosterer of expected medical costs and whether or not you'll be able to contribute to vet bills. (It's OK if you can't help pay. you just have to let people know so they can decide whether they can take on the bills.) Be sure to vet potential fosterers before agreeing to leave your pet with them. Since this is just a forum to connect people. fosterers have not been vetted before joining. You must maintain regular communication with the fosterer. You can agree with the fosterer on how often you want to be in touch and stipulate it in a contract like the one listed above. Please provide the fosterer contact info from a minimum of 4 people in case you're ever without a phone or email. Depending on what you and your fosterer agree to in your contract. if you stop responding to messages from your fosterer or stop reaching out to the fosterer for a duration of time agreed upon in the contract. the pet may be considered abandoned. FOR FOSTERERS Fosterers must have their landlord's approval before offering to foster a pet. Fosterers must be in a financial situation where they can afford to offer stability for any pet you foster. including providing food. water. and shelter. Fosterers must accept that they'll be taking responsibility for the pet for the period of time agreed upon with the owner. Please be understanding that it's hard for people experiencing economic hardship to know when they'll be able to take care of their pet again and life throws curveballs. Fosterers must accept that the pet is not permanently theirs. It must be returned to its owner once they are ready.",1 recent anonymous post,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

Janey. of The Oxford Drunken Knitwits (UK). We're hoping to make the Drunken Knitwits group expand and become international. She has since moved on to taking over the world with her startup and some robots on her side. for now anyways. Our regularly scheduled knitnites are Monday at 7pm. Also find us on meetup! Most of our members will agree that the Drunken Knitwits are hands-down the best knitting clubs in existence today. and probably ever. The first chapter was established in Oxford. UK in 2012 to fill a desperate need for old-fashioned drunken knitting get-togethers. Break-out chapters have been popping up ever since and now we're in 3 continents. 4 countries. and 8 cities. There's no looking back! Whether you're a knitter who needs to add a social aspect to your hobby. someone who's always wanted to learn to knit. or someone who's new to town and wants to take on a new hobby while making friends. then the Drunken Knitwits are the people you‚Äôve been looking for. 3 TENETS OF DRUNKEN KNITHOOD 1. If you're embarrassed to knit in a pub. then you're taking yourself way too seriously. and could use a lesson from a Knitwit. 'Nuff said GET OVER YOURSELF 2. We aim to provide a friendly and welcoming environment to anyone who wishes to join. If you're a true Knitwit. you'll do the same and aim to meet at least one new person at each event you attend. DO UNTO OTHERS 3. We pride ourselves in being an active and committed group. where we can find familiar faces week after week. So come along. and stay for a while -- most Knitwits do. Warnings and Disclaimers: 1. You may have to unpick some knitting mistakes after attending a DK event; we suggest bringing simple projects to avoid this hassle. 2. We use the term 'knit' roughly; if you prefer crochet. that's cool. 3. Drinking is optional; crafting is not.",NA,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Braintree,MA,Massachusetts,42.209284,-70.996304

The advent of Face Book makes this easier. Through the last 12-14 months or so some of us from C-PORT got talking about this wall. talked about how more times than not it is typically at wakes that we see long lost friends and how on those times we yearn to rehash the 'good old days' . to spend some time with our past. However. a wake is never the venue for that. merely a venue to quickly revisit the past. Through the years. like any city neighborhood. many good people leave us. some tragically. some because they were called home. some to find greener grass. We miss them all and hope to never forget them.. The greatest plans never reach fruition unless one takes charge. In this case is was Brenda Gilchrist‚Äôs actions that began this WALL and in the days since we have achieved over 1000 members. a very impressive response to posts. some very touching . funny. and sometimes heartening walks down memory lane. I thank her deeply for her compassionate heart and her longing to help a neighborhood stay connected as fewer and fewer remain. We have also created the ANGEL WALL. a wall that we post those that passed and we have a strong need to never forget. In many ways. as the population of Cambridge moves from the hardened blue collar families of our youth to a young gentrified population with a very different sense of community and history. we are losing the opportunity to bring to life what we remember best of the glory days of our time. of our neighborhood. of our little part of a great city...... We want to communicate to those that are immobile either physically or otherwise. that they too are remembered. We want to continue to extend the spirit of where we grew up. where we hung. where we laughed and cried. shared despair and elation. success and failures. We want to create a vehicle whereby each of you may bring forth the memories of C-Port past so that we accomplish 4 things: 1). We never forget those that passed 2). We NEVER forget where we come from no matter where we are 3). We create a sense of history by sharing our experiences 4). We have fun doing this. Please note that this is a work in progress. We will find out the best way to memorialize our families and friends who have passed on and will post that info when it is figured out. This may include names. dates pictures and streets I thank Brenda for asking me aboard and I thank each and every one of you - for without even one of you in my past. my past is different. some measurable. some maybe not so much. but still different.

Never drive through Chelmsford Center during rush hour. the new lights do nothing to ease the pain. You prefer the old Drum Hill Rotary compared to the autrocity they have now. though there are less accidents apparently. Your idea of an awesome night with friends is hanging out at one of the Dunkin Donuts in town. You can drive through either the Farms I. Farms II. or Stagecoach neighborhoods without getting lost. You wait in line at the Ampet Gas station because it is atleast 10 cents cheaper than the rest of the town. The highlight of the year is the July 4th Country Fair on the town common and parade down North Road. You're a CHS Lion (Maroon and White. LETS FIGHT!) You drive 15 minutes to Nashua. New Hampshire to save 5% in sales tax (Tax Free New Hampshire). Either one of your nextdoor neighbors is over 65. 6 inches of snow is not enough to cancel school for the day; to town officials. it's just a 'dusting.' You know that I-495 is some sort of strange weather dividing line during Nor'easters; every student knows CHS lies outside of 495. NoCho is considered a separate town. You say C-Town. Chelmsdale. or the Cho instead. You've picked out your own pumpkin at Jone's Farm. To go north on Interstate 495. you have to take exit 34. not exit 33. You can name the last movie you saw at Rt. 3 Cinema. You used to get ice cream at the old Skip's ice cream stand after a little league game and remember the massive jug of milk on top. You tell people that some buildings in Springfield (The Simpsons) are based on actual places in Chelmsford because the background artist grew up here. You used to play catch on Strawberry Hill. You place your lawn chair on North Road in June to get good seats for the Fourth of July Prade. You can name the four houses of Chelmsford High. You go to Drum Hill to shop at WalMart. The rest of your shopping can be done in Nashua. Road construction doesn't phase you. it's just a common sight throughout the town year round. You can find the 01824 Post Office and no one from out of town can. You can drive from Chelmsford Center to NoCho without going through Drum Hill. You ice skate at the Forum or at Robert's Field. You call the CrossPoint Towers the Wang Towers still. You considered a beach getaway at Freeman Lake or Baptist Pond. You consider fine dining to be at Bertucci's or Feng Shui. or perhaps Applebee's. You buy your Easter. Halloween. and Christmas candy at Mrs. Nelson's Candy Shop and not the local grocer. You spent your Saturdays as a child at the Little League fields on 110 or at Robert's Field. You go to watch the Chelmsford Lions and CHS Marching Band every Friday night during Fall. You can distinguish the different parts of town from their appearance; NoCho is the ghetto. SoCho has that farm feel. West Chelmsford is affluent. East Chelmsford is a continuation of Lowell. and Chelmsford Center is just traffic. You have been to South Row or CCC to sled. You get ice cream from Sully's. Gary's. or at Kimball's during the summer and know someone who works there. You go to Robert's Field at night to hang out on the playground. You rent the Chelmsford Country Club to host a party. You can name all the routes and roads that radiate out of Chelmsford Center (Rt. 27/Acton Rd: to SoCho. Rt. 4/Boston Rd: to Billerica/Carlisle. Rt. 129/Billerica Rd: to East Chelmsford/Billerica. Rt. 110/Chelmsford St: to Lowell. Rt. 4/North Rd: to NoCho. Old Westford Rd: to West Chelmsford. Rt. 110/Littleton Rd: to Westford). You only hang out on Chelmsford Common on the 4th. You start daydreaming while driving on Turnpike Road. You either go to Russell Mill or Chelmsford Swim & Tennis during the summer. You have to take Rt. 3 or I-495 to get out of town. You can remember some of the stores in the Chelmsford Mall (back in the day). such as F&M. Child's World. Channels. and Bradlee's. and nothing was inside the atrium except for a pet store. travel agency. and Baskin Robins at its low point. Now there's Kohl's. Staples. BestFitness. and PetSmart. You did go to the Chelmsford Mall (back in the day) to see Santa Claus and the elf that looked like Rod Stewart. You either went to McCarthy or Parker Middle Schools. You have watched the Local Government Channel and recognized the people talking and knew what they were talking about. You take an immediate dislike to anyone from Billerica. our arch rivals. Thanksgiving could be the best holiday of the year if we beat them playing football. You drink Chelmsford Ginger Ale (only @ Market Basket). You went on a field trip to the Barrett-Byam and Garrison House to see the colonial ways of life. You have been in the Chelmsford Independent and bragged about it. Paranoia sets in if you can't find a Dunkies or CVS. You know the age of the oldest citizen in Chelmsford. The Purple Beech on the Centre Common. You can name more than 10 local pizza establishments. People look at you in an odd way when describing something as 'wicked' cool. You've been to Forefather's Cemetery at night and it was a little spooky. You always wished to see what the inside of the Little Red Schoolhouse looked like. You know what 'Let the Children Guard What the Sires Have Won' is and where it can be found. You notice the difference between East Chelsmford and West Chelmsford as being like city and country. You actually enjoy driving around rotaries. You look in all possible directions when you're driving through Chicken Corner. You go to the neighboring towns to see their Christmas decorations. We rather spend our budget on a first class education system. You are a member of this great group and a citizen of the greatest town in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...

It is the smallest city in Massachusetts in land area. History The area was first called Winnisimmet. meaning 'good spring nearby.' by the Massachusett tribe which once lived here. It was settled in 1624 by Samuel Maverick. whose palisaded trading post is considered the first permanent settlement at Boston Harbor. In 1635. Maverick sold all of Winnisimmet. except for his house and farm. to Richard Bellingham. The community remained part of Boston until it was set off and incorporated in 1739. when it was named after Chelsea. a neighborhood in London. In 1775. the Battle of Chelsea Creek was fought here. the second battle of the Revolution. at which American forces made one of their first captures of a British ship. Part of Washington's army was stationed here during the Siege of Boston. Chelsea originally included North Chelsea -- all of Revere. Winthrop and parts of Saugus. In 1846. North Chelsea was set off as a separate town. Reincorporated as a city in 1857. Chelsea developed as an industrial center. producing rubber and elastic goods. boots and shoes. stoves and adhesives. It became home to a naval hospital (designed by Alexander Parris) and soldiers' home. But on April 12. 1908. nearly half the city was destroyed in the First Great Chelsea Fire. In 1973. the Second Great Chelsea Fire burned 18 city blocks. In September 1991. Massachusetts enacted special legislation to place Chelsea into receivership. This was the first time since the Great Depression that a United States municipality had such an action taken against it. Events preceding the action included failed financial intervention by the state. a political stalemate over the city's budget. deepening economic decline and a spiraling fiscal crisis. Fortunately. Chelsea had no publicly held long-term debt -- thus. a solution to its problems could be explored in isolation of creditors. A charter change in 1995 designed an efficient council-manager form of government. which has focused on improving the quality of service the city provides to its residents and businesses. while establishing financial policies that have significantly improved the city's financial condition. Increased emphasis on economic development and capital improvement has led to an influx of new business and homebuyers.",NA,Chelsea,MA,Massachusetts,42.396252,-71.032521

It may not be the answer your looking for butUV someone will answer it. ü§£ I am a native so yes I love my town. it been my home for 62 years. it's my childrens home. my family and friends home. even. those who have left. still call Clinton home because we are a unique town and true Clintonians stick together no matter what!

What I‚Äôve learned in my time as admin on this group is that it‚Äôs very important to explain from the start. that this is not a town run. owned. or operated group. This is a simple Facebook group created by one person with a vision for it which was to share memories of what it was like growing up here. or to live here now. We share things about the towns history. and current events. politics aside. It‚Äôs not a place where debates are meant to take place. It is a place for simple enjoyment of one another sharing memories and interesting facts about our town. The group has a simple design and its purposes and goals will be upheld. It is not. I repeat. a town run or administrated or governed group. It is not a politics group and how it is run is not up for vote. However. we are concerned about all of our members and their ability to enjoy their time spent here. The First and most important thing you can do as a new member is to review the rules and agree to abide by them. Welcome and enjoy. Our group is for anyone who either has or does live or work in our great little Town of Clinton MA or has strong ties here. to share memories. history. happenings. pictures. or stories about our town. These stories and sharing. should not be inflammatory. or inciting debate about laws and policies of the town specifically. Thank you. By member vote it was decided long ago that posts of a political nature will not be part of our group. While our group is not an advertising site. members who have local private businesses are welcome to post one ad per month (every 30 days). Official Nonprofits. schools. churches. libraries and community groups/programs are welcome to post one ad per week (7 days) for each event. Commenting on your post is a good way to bring attention to it or add updates/new events VS re-posting outside of these requests. Thank you. Please be sure to read through the group rules. Following them will allow you to post without prior approval from the group administrators/moderators. This group is run by a team that works together to keep the group's purposes. intentions. goals in focus as established by the founder of this group. It is NOT a town-run group. it is a personal group. created for enjoyment of its members. as seen through the vision of the cgroup creator. Rules are meant to keep focus and peace. If you have questions about what is allowed. or concerns about anything that happens in our group. please know you are welcome to come to any of the team (Admins/moderators) and we will be happy to address them for you to the best of our ability. We will not engage in arguments. so please remember when addressing concerns that how the group operates is the decision of the founder and admin team.

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Dedham,MA,Massachusetts,42.243685,-71.163741

This includes to businesses. employees. public officials. protesters. neighbors. pedestrians. motorists. etc. Criticism of a person‚Äôs actions and/or responses is allowed as long as it is done patiently and respectfully. Example of an acceptable criticism: ‚ÄúI disagree with your perspective on the Union Street plan for the following reasons.‚Äù An example of criticism that will be rejected and probably get you thrown out: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being stupid. and I can‚Äôt believe you consider yourself a thinking adult.‚Äù Don‚Äôt say anything that you wouldn‚Äôt say to your best friend. This isn't a big ask. We're glad you're here.",1 recent anonymous post,Easthampton,MA,Massachusetts,42.264319,-72.679921

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Fall River,MA,Massachusetts,41.718221,-71.139991

"GraftonInformed2",Grafton Informed,https://www.facebook.com/groups/GraftonInformed2/,Private,2.1K,2100.0,"Welcome to Grafton Informed! This group was created to provide a free forum for the people who live. work. or own a business in Grafton to stay current with the events that could impact them. The primary purpose of this group is to share information and foster healthy discussion on important issues. regardless of whether or not those topics are made public by the town. Any event that could potentially have an impact on the town of Grafton or one of its occupants (permanent or transient) may be discussed here. Grafton is a wonderful community but as we have seen numerous times in the past. the local government and public service agencies are not always forthcoming with objective information that should be communicated to the citizens in a timely fashion. This is a place to voice those concerns. to get answers to the questions you may have. to collaborate on important issues and help spread the word. As an individual in a town of 18.000+. each one of use is a very small voice. But as an organized group that works collectively. we can make sure that every stakeholder in the town of Grafton is kept informed. Knowledge is power. and when we share knowledge in great numbers. we CAN make a difference in our community! This group relies on crowd sourcing in order to thrive. In other words. every member of this group has an equal voice here and should feel comfortable sharing their opinion or thoughts without reservation. Other Grafton groups suppress member contributions in an attempt to keep posts in a chronological order. While this is a noble effort. the group feature of Facebook is not very conducive to this type of activity. Grafton Informed provides a platform to carry on discussions on these important issues. As long as you abide by the (very) basic rules of the group. we invite you to become a contributing member of this collaborative community!",2 recent anonymous posts,Grafton,MA,Massachusetts,42.200371,-71.686848

I'M HOLLISTON HAPPY was started by local mom. author & intuition life coach Maria Salom√£o-Schmidt because Hollistonians had no real place/way to connect which each other. Maria. known as the 'Tsunami of Love'. wanted to find a way to share that this magical little New England town is one of THE best kept secrets...except to the reporters. authors. politicians. and media people who quietly live here! This site is a gift to the Holliston Community from the Salom√£o-Schmidt family. WHY HOLLISTON? Wonderful schools. caf√©s. a lake with two beaches. horse riding. farms. bike/walking path. lots of playgrounds. nature trails. amazing library system. small hometown shops. outdoor concerts in the summer. lots of family stuff. We can even have horses and chickens in our backyards because we are a farming community! A FABULOUS PLACE to raise children! (Public schools even offer FRENCH IMMERSION and MONTESSORI for FREE!) Lots of history. Great location. Plenty of nature. Be yourself here. connect and build community! :)",9 recent anonymous posts,Holliston,MA,Massachusetts,42.202641,-71.436059

We continue to post memories of Leah and use this group as a place to publicly remember her. We also write about how to navigate the unimaginable - child loss. Leah has been battling pediatric cancer since she was 4 1/2 years-old. In January of 2016. Leah was a happy. healthy. energetic girl who was enjoying pre-k. dance and gym class. cooking and art when out of the blue she started complaining of pains in her arms. In 5 days time her family‚Äôs worst nightmare came true and Leah was diagnosed with metastatic Medulloblastoma. a Pediatric brain cancer that had already spread extensively throughout her spine. She has endured multiple rounds of high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant and spent much of 2016 inpatient at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital. She also had to endure six weeks of proton radiation to her brain and spine at Mass General Hospital. Sadly. Leah was only able to enjoy remission for three months. and her family received the news in early June that her cancer had returned. Leah‚Äôs cancer has no cure once it relapses. She had a major seizure in September which left her in the icu intubated and paralyzed on her right side and she lost the ability to speak. She slowly recovered and was on a targeted chemotherapy which stopped working in December. She was placed on a phase 1 clinical trial and on January 22 we received the news that the cancer was growing again and has spread extensively throughout her brain and spine. We are taking Leah to Augusta. Georgia for a clinical trial in hopes of extending her life. Pediatric cancer is grossly underfunded. Only 4% of federal government cancer research funding goes to study pediatric cancer. We need a cure for these poor babies. Somehow through it all Leah continues to keep a smile on her face. She loves rainbows. emojis and all things pink and purple! For those asking to donate. this is the fundraising page set up for the family: https://www.gofundme.com/medullonomore-for-leah",NA,Hopkinton,MA,Massachusetts,42.219046,-71.530178

"SolidarityLowell",Solidarity Lowell$ a chapter of Progressive Massachusetts,https://www.facebook.com/groups/SolidarityLowell/,Private,1K,1000.0,"MISSION: Solidarity Lowell works toward social justice by defending the human rights. dignity. and equality of all persons against all forms of hate and discrimination. We are a volunteer-based group of Greater Lowell community members and a chapter of Progressive Massachusetts. Vision: Points of Unity Civil Justice: Civil liberties and protection from state repression are critical for the preservation of democracy and human dignity. Economic Justice: We demand an economy that puts the rights of the people above the profits of a few. and we oppose an economy that would strengthen the rich‚Äôs power over the poor. All members of our community ‚Äì undocumented and documented ‚Äì must have economic dignity. Environmental Justice: The ecological crisis. and in particular global warming/climate change. is an urgent human rights challenge; how we mitigate global warming (by ending the use of fossil fuels) and adapt to it is a moral issue. and must be done with speed and equity. Peace: War is a moral abomination. and military force ought to be the last resort in international conflict ‚Äì especially since militarism stifles domestic progress. Racial Justice: Racism is structural. more than a sum of individual prejudicial actions. and must be rooted out of every part of society. We are particularly focused on protecting undocumented and other vulnerable community members in Lowell and are against white supremacy. Sexuality/Gender Justice: Women and LGBTQIA+ people must have full rights. liberation. and freedom.

PLEASE NO SELF-PROMOTION OR ADVERTISING! -KEEP CURB ALERTS TO A MINIMUM: Keep in mind this is a group whose function is to facilitate gifting. While an added benefit of gifting is the ability to de-clutter our spaces. this group is primarily for direct and proactive giving. - TAKE ONLY WHAT IS BEING GIFTED TO YOU AND TAKE THE WHOLE ITEM: Sometimes people give away multiple items and leave them out for the intended recipients to pick up at their convenience. If you are picking up an item take only the item that is designated as being gifted to you. Do not take any other items from the gifter's property. including items marked for someone else. If you arrange to pick up an item take the whole item. do not just take the parts that you want and leave the rest. For example if there is a bureau being offered take the whole bureau not just the drawer pulls that you want. One of the intentions of this group is to keep things out of the trash. If you strip a useful item for parts you've turned that item into trash that the gifter then has to dispose of.

NO BUSINESS POSTS NO REAL ESTATE ADS NO AUTO DEALERSHIP POSTS You are welcome to post pics of items to sell but always add a description. how much you are asking for. and location. Asking price & location must be in the post. Posts such as best offer takes it. PM with offer. etc are not allowed. If item is cross posted please state that. Absolutely NO animal sales of any kind. This is not an auction site. You cannot have bidding wars for an item. The first person who posts interested first gets the item. if they pass you move onto the next person in line and so on. Please post interested on the post before sending a PM so there is an accurate time record for the seller to know who was first and for us to access if there is any issues. If a post is up and you are interested. write interested. If others posted interested before you. they get first 'dibs' down the line in order of interest. DO NOT offer more money on the post or through private message or say i can pick up right now/ asap trying to get the seller to skip everyone to give item to you. If you buy an item/ receive it for free and decide you do not need it. you may re-post it. Post it for the same price you paid for it. Ex: if you buy an item for $20 please resell for $20 or less. Free= Free etc. We do not condone someone buying or receiving items for free to make money. If you are caught/ suspected of flipping items for a profit. you will be messaged and/or banned from the site. Originally it was asked that you wait 24 hrs. for the first person to respond to your post to say if they indeed wanted it but it is a long time. some people do have jobs and are not at their computers 24/7. Please use your good judgement/ common sense & give the person to the end of the day when they could be out of work/ home before moving onto the next person. So that someone doesn't get passed. when you say interested. say that you may be away from computer for X amount of time or check in periodically as the item may be passed onto you. Please try not to tie up an item. Please delete post after items have sold! If you don't know how. post 'sold' on the post so we can delete it. If it is an album of items. write 'sold dresser. all others still avail' so everyone knows what has sold & what hasn't. Also so we don't delete your album. NO selling knock off items. Please wait 24 hrs. before bumping. We are not held responsible for items sold here. Use your own discretion when buying an item from someone. 'Buyer Beware'. ALL sales are final.. So check the item BEFORE money is exchanged. Do not harass/threaten other members. No name bashing. Any questions contact Tina Lawrence.

Veteran Sarah O'Hearn. who ultimately lost her battle with SUD. (Substance Use Disorder). The purpose of this group is to provide support to those who are affected by SUD or families of those affected by SUD. The admins work behind the scenes. with people to help find beds for treatment. People are urged to pm one of the admins if they require assistance. Lists of available beds are posted daily as a tool to aid the search. There are other means to find available resources. Right now we are providing that information on an as needed basis. Our goal. going forward. is to have all of the files updated so that anyone seeking assistance will be able to do so just by accessing the files. We will never deny assistance. but in doing this. it frees us up to work more on advocacy and become more pro-active in the fight against SUD. As things happen. we will update everyone. as things will be rolling out at different times. As you know. all posts are reviewed by admins prior to posting to the page. Moving forward. we will be taking the extra step to make sure duplicate posts are not posted to the page. in order to prevent the page from being flooded with the same thing multiple times.

Use your discretion in posting news involving on-going police investigations. local accidents or school incidents. We have incredibly qualified and thoughtful professional leaders at our police and fire departments. town offices. and school district. They are the best authorities to disseminate such news to the public. Once they have done so. by all means feel free to copy their messages or links to anything they have posted for the public here. 5. Negative reviews of local businesses are prohibited. Such posts and comments can be destructive to those trying to make a living in our community and it is impossible for administrators to verify the veracity of such comments. Again. you are free to voice your opinion on your personal page. 6. When annoyed. consider moving on without commenting or attacking the source of your annoyance and when in doubt about what to write. err on the side of kindness. You'll never regret doing so. 7. Don't make any comment to someone that you wouldn't say to them if you were standing in line next to them at the Muffin House with your kids watching. Which brings me to the next rule... 8.

Simply post a picture and description of what you are gifting or seeking. Any interested member should comment on that post. and then may arrange pick up/drop off via PM. The first person to respond should receive the item. if 24 hours pass with no response from that person then go the next person. Share the wealth. if you have claimed items recently please pass to another member. If someone is asking you to pick up in another city/town. please pm me as this is against the rules. There should only be Melrose residents here with pickup location also only in Melrose. Members have requested that all posts be either labeled as 'gone'. 'rehomed'. or deleted so they will be aware when an item is no longer available.

Monson Massachusetts was first settled in the year 1715 and was officially incorporated in 1775. The town was named after Sir John Monson. a friend of the governor.[1] Monson was largely a mill town until most of the mills in town closed down due to poor business. Monson also had a large granite quarry that was opened by Rufus Flynt. later owned by his oldest son William Flynt. It was closed around 1935. On the afternoon of June 1. 2011 a tornado struck and caused extensive damage to the center of town. Trivia: Monson. like its neighboring town of Hampden. does not have a single traffic light. but it does have a blinking light at the intersection of Route 32 and High Street in the center of town.

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,New Bedford,MA,Massachusetts,41.634749,-70.9372

Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Newton,MA,Massachusetts,42.3545,-71.1877

Reading and surrounding town residents who oppose development of a massive apartment complex in a quiet residential area adjacent to wetlands and the Ipswich river. Nick Yebba. Sr. owner of Theresa's Prime has filed a development proposal under Mass 40B to build 200 units for rent on the Theresa's Prime/Resorts North location. Everyone in North Reading stands to be impacted by this development. Taxes. Schools. Traffic. Town resources. etc. None of these concerns will prevent the development from happening. What can potentially halt this project is the impact it will have on our water source and conservation of the Ipswich River since the proposed location is right on the Ipswich river. North Reading residents aren't the only ones being affected. Lynnfield residents will be impacted as well. because they draw their water supply from the Ipswich River. West Peabody and Middleton. as well as Lynnfield will be effected because the proposed development site is located near the town lines. Let's work together to strategize ways to stop this proposal from getting approved as it currently stands. Though Yebba is within his right to propose his property in this way. he has shown a complete disregard for conservation of the Ipswich river. the surrounding quiet neighborhoods. the town and residents that have all welcomed him and supported his restaurants. Please share this group with others and alert as many people as possible of this. Please plan to attend as many public meetings as possible. Again. we all stand to be impacted here.

It can make a big difference in finding the vital records. etc. in the right place! Also. the boundaries between Rhode Island and Massachusetts were not firmly established until much later. This has made it difficult for researchers to find the records in this area. The Town of Rehoboth was much larger originally. Today. half of it is in Massachusetts while the other half is in Rhode Island. The eastern half remained as part of Bristol County. Massachusetts today. The western half became part of Rhode Island; this portion is now East Providence and Seekonk area. Rumford has previously been part of three towns and two states; Rehoboth. Massachusetts. Seekonk. Massachusetts. and East Providence. Rhode Island. It became part of Rhode Island in 1862.

Massachusetts. The neighborhood is located on a peninsula surrounded by Town River Bay on the west and Rock Island Cove on the east. This peninsula was known since the 1640s as ‚ÄúShed's Neck‚Äù. Palmer Street. the main thoroughfare of the neighborhood. was named for General Joseph Palmer. In 1752 Palmer and Richard Cranch. brother in law of John Adams and father of American jurist William Cranch. were held by tenure of lease by a company interested in German immigration to create a planned manufacturing community. The land was to be settled in the 1750s by a group of glassmakers and weavers from Germany. The planned community was a failure by 1760. but the name has remained since that time. By the late 18th century. ship building became the major industry because of the ideal location of the neighborhood. In 1861. ferry service was established between Germantown and Quincy Point. The tallest building in the neighborhood is the seven-story O'Brien Towers. Most children in Germantown go to Snug Harbor for elementary school. Broad Meadows for middle school. and Quincy High for high school. Snug Harbor is the only school physically within the neighborhood. The neighborhood has a small general store (Palmer Street Store. also known as the blue store...LESTER'S!!!). In 2007. the city opened the Germantown Neighborhood Center in the former St. Boniface Church for use in a variety of neighborhood educational and community functions. - But for those of Us that grew up there. it will always be known as G-Town.",3 posts a day,Quincy,MA,Massachusetts,42.249133,-70.997816

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Salem,MA,Massachusetts,42.515114,-70.900343

Early on. it was nicknamed 'Poverty Plains' because the land was thought to be infertile. Its first residential home was built by Samuel Fowler and his wife Naomi Noble on what is now College Highway (US 202 and MA 10). about a quarter-mile north of the current town center. In colonial times. church attendance was mandatory. The 800 Christian residents of Southwick in the 1760‚Äì1770s were required to travel to Westfield to congregate. Only by establishing their own church community could they establish their own parish. as they desired. On November 7. 1770. Southwick was incorporated as a separate district of Westfield. The area of Southwick became somewhat smaller in 1770. The southernmost portion of Southwick joined Suffield. Connecticut. as the result of a simultaneous secession of citizens in that part of the village. Independence Southwick became a fully independent town in 1770. The town remained divided until 1793. when Massachusetts claimed the area (known as the 'jog'). A border dispute continued until 1804. when the current boundary was established through a compromise between Connecticut and Massachusetts. As a result of this border resolution. Southwick is the southernmost town in western Massachusetts.",NA,Southwick,MA,Massachusetts,42.051099,-72.770588

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Tewksbury,MA,Massachusetts,42.60283,-71.223224

Covering 80 acres (320.000 m). the park featured a plethora of rides and other attractions. including the Space Rocket ride. the Pirate Ride. the Moby-Dick ride (which featured a spouting mechanical whale rising from the depths). the Wreck of the Hesperus (dark ride). the Old Chisholm Trail (dark ride). theme restaurants. a shopping area. an arcade. mini-golf (from 1967). a carousel. Monkey Island. and many others. Actors would stage mock gunfights in the Western City or threaten to attack riders on the boat rides. The park's Old Smokey Railroad Line was a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railroad using equipment leased from the Edaville Railroad. Another park feature was the Show Bowl. where performers such as Ricky Nelson. Michael Landon. The Modernaires. the Three Stooges. Clayton Moore. Don Ameche. and Cesar Romero appeared. Product placement and branding played a part in some attractions. such as the Grist Mill which featured Pepperidge Farm products and the Pepsi-Cola Diamond Lil Theater.

Buzzards Bay and Onset. I feel privileged that I have the opportunity to travel down the lovely stretch of 6-28. as it winds it's was through Wareham. Nothing beats a pond that regularly forms in the middle of a highway. every time it rains and especially when you're late for work. The journey that lead to the creation of this page. started when I was summarily removed from the 'other' Wareham Matters Page. apparently for a bit too much tomfoolery and ballyhoo. After being kicked out of Wareham Matters (unofficial). I wandered the streets aimlessly and wept for many hours. eventually crying myself to sleep. After many months of counseling and cognitive therapy.

We continue to post memories of Leah and use this group as a place to publicly remember her. We also write about how to navigate the unimaginable - child loss. Leah has been battling pediatric cancer since she was 4 1/2 years-old. In January of 2016. Leah was a happy. healthy. energetic girl who was enjoying pre-k. dance and gym class. cooking and art when out of the blue she started complaining of pains in her arms. In 5 days time her family‚Äôs worst nightmare came true and Leah was diagnosed with metastatic Medulloblastoma. a Pediatric brain cancer that had already spread extensively throughout her spine. She has endured multiple rounds of high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant and spent much of 2016 inpatient at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital. She also had to endure six weeks of proton radiation to her brain and spine at Mass General Hospital. Sadly. Leah was only able to enjoy remission for three months. and her family received the news in early June that her cancer had returned. Leah‚Äôs cancer has no cure once it relapses. She had a major seizure in September which left her in the icu intubated and paralyzed on her right side and she lost the ability to speak. She slowly recovered and was on a targeted chemotherapy which stopped working in December. She was placed on a phase 1 clinical trial and on January 22 we received the news that the cancer was growing again and has spread extensively throughout her brain and spine. We are taking Leah to Augusta. Georgia for a clinical trial in hopes of extending her life. Pediatric cancer is grossly underfunded. Only 4% of federal government cancer research funding goes to study pediatric cancer. We need a cure for these poor babies. Somehow through it all Leah continues to keep a smile on her face. She loves rainbows. emojis and all things pink and purple!

Your business must be in Worcester County. Not a business from outside Worcester county that does business here in Worcester County. Not a person who lives outside of Worcester County who works from home and says they 'work in Worcester County.' Not a business who's shop is located out of Worcester County Massachusetts but travels to Worcester County Massachusetts. Not Worcester County in England. Our goal is that people who are self employed will be able to advertise on this site so others will be able to see the wonderful services that we provide and will be able to connect with each one of us to help our business's. Networking with other business's is a great way to get to know one another and be able to utilize other's services. Worcester County Networking. its managers. agents or other representatives of this site accept no liability for the content of this site. as always - buyer beware. There are SEVERAL fb groups who do advertisement. WE are not the last chance corral. Rules : 1) With over 800 people in the group. there are bound to be disagreements. Please take those disagreements to a personal message so the other folks in the group do not have to be subject to arguments. Please respect each other and the group. 2) If you started with the group with a particular field but now wish to advertise something completely different. please ask Admin first. Some groups are closed and therefore you would be asked to wait until space frees up. 3) Always remember that there are usually more than just one member from a particular field and therefore give others from that field time to post. At this point lets try to limit posting from any one business (not field) once per day. 4) If you would like to do a post that has nothing to do with your field please check with admin first. We want to maintain the focus of our group. 5) If Admin finds that a particular field is not being represented - new members of that field will be accepted. 6) In our group we want 'active' members. We want to know who you are and what service you provide. The definition of 'active' in our group is to post at least weekly and no more than once per day for each business you have been approved to advertise. We have built an amazing group where we want everyone to know your name so please don't' be shy. Get involved in the group by supporting others business's and asking questions. Non active members run the risk of being deleted if some one else wants to advertise in this group in your field. We have several requests to join each day. 7) admin reserves the right to add new rules or change pre-existing ones. 8) Remember there is no test or back ground check to be a member. Always ask for proof of insurance and identity. Buyer beware. 9) Have fun",NA,Worcester,MA,Massachusetts,42.2621,-71.8034

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Worcester,MA,Massachusetts,42.2621,-71.8034

Donate things that other people need. or just give away the things you don't need any longer. to keep our landfills clean. No Spamming allowed! This Group is ONLY for Residences of Norfolk Ma and Wrentham Ma Please DELETE your post after the item has been picked up or you've received what you are looking for to keep the feed clean. 1. ***I would prefer that EVERY post start with ISO. WANTED. or OFFER. It is sometimes difficult to understand what someone is doing when these words are omitted. 2. ***If you see something you want. mark the post with 'INTERESTED' in the comments and then PM the person with a day and time you think you can come. FIRST PERSON TO COMMENT INTERESTED. IS FIRST IN LINE. NO EXCEPTIONS; However. if the person cannot make arrangements within an acceptable time frame for the person offering the item ‚Äì they can reserve the right to say ‚Äì sorry. I need to move on. It is the givers discretion how quickly they need an item picked up. It is absolutely ok to say ‚ÄúI need this gone today‚Äù Or ‚Äúpreference to fastest pickup‚Äù. 3. ***Cross Posting***To Be fair to ALL members. if you are X - Posting your item on another site. please put this in your post. 4. ***If your ISO posts have been inactive for over 30 days. we can only assume you either received the item or forgot about it. Hopefully you received it. Either way it will be removed to keep the feed clean. 5. ***IF YOU MAKE A COMMITTMENT AND CANNOT KEEP IT ‚Äì YOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFIY THE OTHER PARTY! REPEAT OFFENDERS OF BEING ‚ÄúNO SHOWS‚Äù WILL BE BANNED. Life is life and unexpected stuff happens ‚Äì but we will not tolerate continual disrespect and rudeness here. Being a no show is both of those things. If you notify someone that you are no longer going to be able to take the item and can't keep the commitment ‚Äì this is NOT a no show. A no show is someone who states a date and time and does not tell you they are not coming. If you have to skip out on meeting someone make every attempt to let them know. If you cannot reach them. post in the group and tag them with the time you were supposed to meet them so we can see that an attempt was made at a reasonable time before the meet up. 6. ***It is absolutely NOT ok to pick up items with the intention of resale*** If you are found to be doing this. ‚Äì you will be removed and banned. The EXCEPTION to this is if you are a ‚Äúscrap metaler‚Äù (you provide the community a great service in taking this stuff off our hands) 7. ***NO SPAM or phishing posts. they will be deleted immediately and the user blocked from the group. 8. ***NO LINKS to groups or donation without explicit permission from an Admin. No gift cards. cash. or Go Fund groups. No posting of missing persons pets or missing pets. 9. Please bump your post every 3 days 10. any questions please ask -Admin.
