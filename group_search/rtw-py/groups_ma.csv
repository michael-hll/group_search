All participants divided into group settings to discuss the top priority issues of our town. One of the top 4 listed was communication. Most people feel the needs of some kind of communication channels for townspeople. I was one of the participants. I would like to start it from here. Again this group is designed for information sharing all things Acton related. not for reporting emergency cases. It is intended for quick information sharing. e.g. town meetings. neighborhood helpers needed. events. volunteers recruiting. neighborhood alerts (besides policy/emergency report). road conditions. etc. Any advertisement for out of town business will be removed immediately. All ads are not repeatable. Politics? It is hard to completely avoid. For instance. we may discuss town meetings. how article was proposed. That is when things get muddy. Only thing I hope us as well balanced Actonians. is to respect each other. conduct productive conversations. For any specific topics. subjects. especially for a project/proposal with long term goals. people may form a separate forums to discuss. I will update the resource references below periodically as needed. Again please be respectful and considerate to others when we write on the public forum. * This forum should NOT be used for any individual campaigning. Thank you for your cooperation.

Talkers are encouraged to discuss community issues. local politics. education. events. and other community topics. but we do ask that the discussions always be polite. mature. and focused on Amesbury and how we can all make Amesbury a better place to live and work. We encourage local politicians and citizens running for office to introduce themselves. share their office/campaign pages. and to discuss their positions on local issues with the AT public. Political discussion can easily become heated. We ask that everyone be respectful of differing opinions and always follow the rules of decorum. THIS IS A MODERATED FORUM. While we encourage vigorous debate. Please observe the rules of decorum at all times. We’re aware that not everyone will always agree with moderator editorial decisions. which is fine. but we will attempt (to the best of our collective abilities) to make sure this forum stays friendly. welcoming. and most importantly… provides useful information to the citizens of Amesbury.

Please DELETE your post after the item has been picked up or you've received what you are looking for to keep the feed clean. 1. ***I would prefer that EVERY post start with ISO. WANTED. or OFFER. It is sometimes difficult to understand what someone is doing when these words are omitted. 2. ***If you see something you want. mark the post with 'INTERESTED' in the comments and then PM the person with a day and time you think you can come. FIRST PERSON TO COMMENT INTERESTED. IS FIRST IN LINE. NO EXCEPTIONS; However. if the person cannot make arrangements within an acceptable time frame for the person offering the item – they can reserve the right to say – sorry. I need to move on. It is the givers discretion how quickly they need an item picked up. It is absolutely ok to say “I need this gone today” Or “preference to fastest pickup”. 3. ***Cross Posting***To Be fair to ALL members. if you are X - Posting your item on another site. please put this in your post. 4. ***If your ISO posts have been inactive for over 30 days. we can only assume you either received the item or forgot about it. Hopefully you received it. Either way it will be removed to keep the feed clean. 5. ***IF YOU MAKE A COMMITTMENT AND CANNOT KEEP IT – YOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFIY THE OTHER PARTY! REPEAT OFFENDERS OF BEING “NO SHOWS” WILL BE BANNED. Life is life and unexpected stuff happens – but we will not tolerate continual disrespect and rudeness here. Being a no show is both of those things. If you notify someone that you are no longer going to be able to take the item and can't keep the commitment – this is NOT a no show. A no show is someone who states a date and time and does not tell you they are not coming. If you have to skip out on meeting someone make every attempt to let them know. If you cannot reach them. post in the group and tag them with the time you were supposed to meet them so we can see that an attempt was made at a reasonable time before the meet up. 6. ***It is absolutely NOT ok to pick up items with the intention of resale*** If you are found to be doing this. – you will be removed and banned.

PRESS RELEASE https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/705-22/mayor-adams-nyc-h-h-ceo-katz-successful-rollout-expansion-plant-based-meals-as [2] Created marriages for hundreds of vegan couples. [3] Saved the lives of billions of animals. [4] Converted thousands of carnivores & vegetarians into vegans. These groups are moderated by a team of volunteers who ensure that only relevant and valuable content is shared. With over 200 cities represented. these vegan groups continue to make a positive impact and are an essential resource for those looking to join the vegan community. The vegan movement has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. with more people than ever before choosing to adopt a vegan lifestyle. This is largely due to the rise of social media. which has enabled vegan activists to reach a much wider audience. The success of these vegan Facebook groups is a testament to the power of social media. and the impact it can have on the vegan movement. These groups have become a hub for vegan activists. providing a platform for them to share their stories. recipes. advice. and events. These groups have also been instrumental in helping to convert thousands of people to veganism. Through their posts and discussions. they have been able to educate and inform people about the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. and the impact it can have on the environment and animal welfare. Through their work. they have been able to save the lives of billions of animals. and help to create a more sustainable future.

Because if it is generic than there will be huge numbers out there and there will not be enough time to have fun even if it is 24/7 then we may end up quiting our jobs :) Just that we might have lots in common to share no other intention. if you feel you also have lots in common with Indians and or interested to have more Indian friends and want to know more about them . you are most welcome to join the group.

If you’re a licensed salesperson or broker in Massachusetts. this is a place to come together and share any off-market or coming soon opportunities to help create exposure for your client and have an open forum with like-minded local real estate agents. Posting Rules: Please share only non-MLS. pre-market or coming soon listings. Do NOT share anything that’s listed on MLS unless it’s in CSO “coming soon” status. Please make sure to post the address (or at least street/town) & price (or range). MLS Rules: Please adhere to all rules of your MLS and local boards. If you think you’re skirting ANY rules or regulations please talk with your broker of record. Sharing Rules: Please do not share any listing. information about a listing. or photos posted by another agent/broker within this group PUBLICLY without the consent of the brokerage – that means no advertising another agent’s listing in any medium.

In Search Of (ISO) Posts: We will allow these but PLEASE be as detailed as possible and keep them to a minimum. Claiming you have a buyer in search of a flip or condo conversion project for an unlimited budget and anywhere near Boston doesn't do anyone any good.

We LOVE these conversations and being able to use this group as an open forum and sounding board to discuss what’s happening in our market. But please be respectful of the perspective of others at all times. Self-promotion: Promoting yourself here is not allowed. Don’t even go there.

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

Business owners. please promote your business. Post your Facebook Page. website link. product or service info. and any deals or sales you have going on. Area Residents. if you are looking for a product or service please ask in this group! Someone may connect you to the right person offering that product or service. Tell your friends and neighbors about businesses. specials and products posted in the group. Why support local businesses and business owners? Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy. What most people don’t realize is that they provide over half of the jobs in this country. But there is a deeper reason as to why you. as a consumer. would want to support the small businesses within your community. When you spend your money to buy products and services from locally owned businesses. more of that money stays in the local economy. This means more money is available for schools. recreation. and other infrastructure that is important to your community. DISCLAIMER Group Admins.

Feel free to post photos of your items. a brief description. price and location or post about that special item you are trying to find at a bargain price. Happy selling! Here are a few ground rules.... 1. Please add a description of the item that includes your location. the condition. and your price. Your photo should show the true quality of your item. so that the buyer knows exactly what they are purchasing. It is also advisable that you make sure that your item is cleaned and looks presentable. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD ANY EXPIRED SAFETY ITEMS BE SOLD!!! This includes cribs and car seats. Children are our most precious resources and their safety is a most important concern! 2 Price your items fairly. It is a good idea to see what similar items are going for on the site. When in doubt. take half the retail value and use that as your starting point. 3. Generally. it is the buyer's responsibility to come to the seller to pick up the purchase. You can make other arrangements. 4. Please pick up all items in a timely manner. This is only fair to the seller. Likewise. sellers please be timely in contacting the buyer! The seller has the right to determine if a fair amount of time has passed before re-posting. 5. The buyer should make arrangements to pick up the items within a week. unless you and the seller have agreed on another time. 6. If an item has sold and has been picked up by the buyer. please DELETE the photo immediately! 7. It is only polite. and fair. to bump your items only once or twice a week. If your photo bumping becomes excessive. you will be asked to leave the group. 8. ABSOLUTELY. POSITIVELY NO SOLICITING! 9.This site is ONLY used for the sale. swap or giveaway of baby. toddler and children items. Any non-related items will be deleted and your membership may be revoked. You may contact me directly for possible exceptions. 10. Regarding second hand car seats. this is the recommendation from the MassGov website: Additional Note on Second Hand Seats : It is not recommended that you use a second hand seat. If you do have a second hand seat make sure you know the history of the seat. Do not use a seat that has been involved in a motor vehicle crash. Do not use a seat that is six or more years old. It is also very important you contact the manufacturer to check for possible recalls on the seat and register the seat so you will be notified of any future recalls. Again it is not recommended that you use any second hand seat! Go to http://www.mass.gov/eopss/crime-prev-personal-sfty/traffic-safety/cps/ for more information. 11.

Say hello and get to know our members so we can also get to know you! www.teamrwb.org/chapter/team-rwb-boston-ma Group Rules and Policies: Members should not advertise for other groups or businesses. There are exceptions to this rule. particularly when an organization is a committed partner or is a donor/supporter of this chapter. If it is a free opportunity that can be useful to many members. please share. For example. some of our members own local gyms or other businesses. These members often arrange events in their place of business for the benefit of our members. Team RWB is deeply appreciative of these partnerships and encourages sharing them so members can attend. Please do not post anything politically or socially divisive to the group. We are an apolitical organization that strives to be inclusive in nature and need to maintain that status in order to maximize our reach. If you find divisive content which you feel is inappropriate please notify an admin. Team RWB members should not post fundraising links for other groups or causes. Posts which directly ask for donations or directly sell things to fundraise for a non-RWB charity are not permitted. We appreciate your charity work and we understand that many of our members are often involved in other groups. However. at an organizational level we can not directly fundraise for those charities. The most common approach which is permitted here is to share an event you are hosting or involved in which itself may be a fundraising event. The key difference is that you are not asking for money but rather are inviting members to attend. even if it includes a cover cost. Please keep the frequency of such posts reasonable. Team RWB groups are not the place to transfer and give away race bibs. Team RWB has many partnerships and bib sharing often violates regulations and puts these partnerships in jeopardy. Even if you know that a particular race allows bib transfers. please refrain from openly posting about it within the group. You are encouraged to discuss the race itself. to include sharing or asking for information and directing members to official race organizers. However. any requests to send or receive a bib transfer must not be made in the group and should be discussed with the race organizers and privately between race participants. This is not the place to discuss the status or members' opinions of other organizations. Team RWB has many partnerships at the national and local level and negative posts have the ability to damage those partnerships. no matter how small. Team RWB is a positive. safe place and negative messages about other organizations may turn some members away. Content that is negative in nature (attacks on other members. defamatory statements. VA bashing. etc.) is not in alignment with our Eagle Ethos and has no place in our organization. If you find negative content which you feel is inappropriate please notify an admin.",NA,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

Post what kind of help you're looking for. or respond to a post made by a volunteer fosterer. Looking to help the community by fostering a pet that needs a temporary home while its owner recovers stability. and can you offer a stable home for their pet in the meantime? Post what kind of help you can give. or respond to a post made by someone looking for pet help. We recommend that pet fosterers and owners sign a contract between themselves before handing over the pet in order to ensure good communication. Here's a sample of a foster agreement to use or adapt! Please read over carefully: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiKlBPOJrLgHFo19PFFkirl-qupnT-RHStzqetPfVyA/edit Any admins and moderators of this group are not responsible for anything that happens to a fostered pet. or people or animals it interacts with. or destruction of property caused by a pet. Admins and moderators are not legally or personally responsible for enforcing the group rules. The most they can do is block someone from this Facebook group. Please keep this in mind before posting! -------- Before you post please read the rules: FOR PEOPLE SEEKING A FOSTERER If you're looking for foster help with your pet. inform any potential fosterer of expected medical costs and whether or not you'll be able to contribute to vet bills. (It's OK if you can't help pay. you just have to let people know so they can decide whether they can take on the bills.) Be sure to vet potential fosterers before agreeing to leave your pet with them. Since this is just a forum to connect people. fosterers have not been vetted before joining. You must maintain regular communication with the fosterer. You can agree with the fosterer on how often you want to be in touch and stipulate it in a contract like the one listed above. Please provide the fosterer contact info from a minimum of 4 people in case you're ever without a phone or email. Depending on what you and your fosterer agree to in your contract. if you stop responding to messages from your fosterer or stop reaching out to the fosterer for a duration of time agreed upon in the contract. the pet may be considered abandoned. FOR FOSTERERS Fosterers must have their landlord's approval before offering to foster a pet. Fosterers must be in a financial situation where they can afford to offer stability for any pet you foster. including providing food. water. and shelter. Fosterers must accept that they'll be taking responsibility for the pet for the period of time agreed upon with the owner. Please be understanding that it's hard for people experiencing economic hardship to know when they'll be able to take care of their pet again and life throws curveballs. Fosterers must accept that the pet is not permanently theirs. It must be returned to its owner once they are ready.",1 recent anonymous post,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

Janey. of The Oxford Drunken Knitwits (UK). We're hoping to make the Drunken Knitwits group expand and become international. She has since moved on to taking over the world with her startup and some robots on her side. for now anyways. Our regularly scheduled knitnites are Monday at 7pm. Also find us on meetup! Most of our members will agree that the Drunken Knitwits are hands-down the best knitting clubs in existence today. and probably ever. The first chapter was established in Oxford. UK in 2012 to fill a desperate need for old-fashioned drunken knitting get-togethers. Break-out chapters have been popping up ever since and now we're in 3 continents. 4 countries. and 8 cities. There's no looking back! Whether you're a knitter who needs to add a social aspect to your hobby. someone who's always wanted to learn to knit. or someone who's new to town and wants to take on a new hobby while making friends. then the Drunken Knitwits are the people you’ve been looking for. 3 TENETS OF DRUNKEN KNITHOOD 1. If you're embarrassed to knit in a pub. then you're taking yourself way too seriously. and could use a lesson from a Knitwit. 'Nuff said GET OVER YOURSELF 2. We aim to provide a friendly and welcoming environment to anyone who wishes to join. If you're a true Knitwit. you'll do the same and aim to meet at least one new person at each event you attend. DO UNTO OTHERS 3. We pride ourselves in being an active and committed group. where we can find familiar faces week after week. So come along. and stay for a while -- most Knitwits do. Warnings and Disclaimers: 1. You may have to unpick some knitting mistakes after attending a DK event; we suggest bringing simple projects to avoid this hassle. 2. We use the term 'knit' roughly; if you prefer crochet. that's cool. 3. Drinking is optional; crafting is not.",NA,Boston,MA,Massachusetts,42.357603,-71.068432

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Braintree,MA,Massachusetts,42.209284,-70.996304

The advent of Face Book makes this easier. Through the last 12-14 months or so some of us from C-PORT got talking about this wall. talked about how more times than not it is typically at wakes that we see long lost friends and how on those times we yearn to rehash the 'good old days' . to spend some time with our past. However. a wake is never the venue for that. merely a venue to quickly revisit the past. Through the years. like any city neighborhood. many good people leave us. some tragically. some because they were called home. some to find greener grass. We miss them all and hope to never forget them.. The greatest plans never reach fruition unless one takes charge. In this case is was Brenda Gilchrist’s actions that began this WALL and in the days since we have achieved over 1000 members. a very impressive response to posts. some very touching . funny. and sometimes heartening walks down memory lane. I thank her deeply for her compassionate heart and her longing to help a neighborhood stay connected as fewer and fewer remain. We have also created the ANGEL WALL. a wall that we post those that passed and we have a strong need to never forget. In many ways. as the population of Cambridge moves from the hardened blue collar families of our youth to a young gentrified population with a very different sense of community and history. we are losing the opportunity to bring to life what we remember best of the glory days of our time. of our neighborhood. of our little part of a great city...... We want to communicate to those that are immobile either physically or otherwise. that they too are remembered. We want to continue to extend the spirit of where we grew up. where we hung. where we laughed and cried. shared despair and elation. success and failures. We want to create a vehicle whereby each of you may bring forth the memories of C-Port past so that we accomplish 4 things: 1). We never forget those that passed 2). We NEVER forget where we come from no matter where we are 3). We create a sense of history by sharing our experiences 4). We have fun doing this. Please note that this is a work in progress. We will find out the best way to memorialize our families and friends who have passed on and will post that info when it is figured out. This may include names. dates pictures and streets I thank Brenda for asking me aboard and I thank each and every one of you - for without even one of you in my past. my past is different. some measurable. some maybe not so much. but still different.

Never drive through Chelmsford Center during rush hour. the new lights do nothing to ease the pain. You prefer the old Drum Hill Rotary compared to the autrocity they have now. though there are less accidents apparently. Your idea of an awesome night with friends is hanging out at one of the Dunkin Donuts in town. You can drive through either the Farms I. Farms II. or Stagecoach neighborhoods without getting lost. You wait in line at the Ampet Gas station because it is atleast 10 cents cheaper than the rest of the town. The highlight of the year is the July 4th Country Fair on the town common and parade down North Road. You're a CHS Lion (Maroon and White. LETS FIGHT!) You drive 15 minutes to Nashua. New Hampshire to save 5% in sales tax (Tax Free New Hampshire). Either one of your nextdoor neighbors is over 65. 6 inches of snow is not enough to cancel school for the day; to town officials. it's just a 'dusting.' You know that I-495 is some sort of strange weather dividing line during Nor'easters; every student knows CHS lies outside of 495. NoCho is considered a separate town. You say C-Town. Chelmsdale. or the Cho instead. You've picked out your own pumpkin at Jone's Farm. To go north on Interstate 495. you have to take exit 34. not exit 33. You can name the last movie you saw at Rt. 3 Cinema. You used to get ice cream at the old Skip's ice cream stand after a little league game and remember the massive jug of milk on top. You tell people that some buildings in Springfield (The Simpsons) are based on actual places in Chelmsford because the background artist grew up here. You used to play catch on Strawberry Hill. You place your lawn chair on North Road in June to get good seats for the Fourth of July Prade. You can name the four houses of Chelmsford High. You go to Drum Hill to shop at WalMart. The rest of your shopping can be done in Nashua. Road construction doesn't phase you. it's just a common sight throughout the town year round. You can find the 01824 Post Office and no one from out of town can. You can drive from Chelmsford Center to NoCho without going through Drum Hill. You ice skate at the Forum or at Robert's Field. You call the CrossPoint Towers the Wang Towers still. You considered a beach getaway at Freeman Lake or Baptist Pond. You consider fine dining to be at Bertucci's or Feng Shui. or perhaps Applebee's. You buy your Easter. Halloween. and Christmas candy at Mrs. Nelson's Candy Shop and not the local grocer. You spent your Saturdays as a child at the Little League fields on 110 or at Robert's Field. You go to watch the Chelmsford Lions and CHS Marching Band every Friday night during Fall. You can distinguish the different parts of town from their appearance; NoCho is the ghetto. SoCho has that farm feel. West Chelmsford is affluent. East Chelmsford is a continuation of Lowell. and Chelmsford Center is just traffic. You have been to South Row or CCC to sled. You get ice cream from Sully's. Gary's. or at Kimball's during the summer and know someone who works there. You go to Robert's Field at night to hang out on the playground. You rent the Chelmsford Country Club to host a party. You can name all the routes and roads that radiate out of Chelmsford Center (Rt. 27/Acton Rd: to SoCho. Rt. 4/Boston Rd: to Billerica/Carlisle. Rt. 129/Billerica Rd: to East Chelmsford/Billerica. Rt. 110/Chelmsford St: to Lowell. Rt. 4/North Rd: to NoCho. Old Westford Rd: to West Chelmsford. Rt. 110/Littleton Rd: to Westford). You only hang out on Chelmsford Common on the 4th. You start daydreaming while driving on Turnpike Road. You either go to Russell Mill or Chelmsford Swim & Tennis during the summer. You have to take Rt. 3 or I-495 to get out of town. You can remember some of the stores in the Chelmsford Mall (back in the day). such as F&M. Child's World. Channels. and Bradlee's. and nothing was inside the atrium except for a pet store. travel agency. and Baskin Robins at its low point. Now there's Kohl's. Staples. BestFitness. and PetSmart. You did go to the Chelmsford Mall (back in the day) to see Santa Claus and the elf that looked like Rod Stewart. You either went to McCarthy or Parker Middle Schools. You have watched the Local Government Channel and recognized the people talking and knew what they were talking about. You take an immediate dislike to anyone from Billerica. our arch rivals. Thanksgiving could be the best holiday of the year if we beat them playing football. You drink Chelmsford Ginger Ale (only @ Market Basket). You went on a field trip to the Barrett-Byam and Garrison House to see the colonial ways of life. You have been in the Chelmsford Independent and bragged about it. Paranoia sets in if you can't find a Dunkies or CVS. You know the age of the oldest citizen in Chelmsford. The Purple Beech on the Centre Common. You can name more than 10 local pizza establishments. People look at you in an odd way when describing something as 'wicked' cool. You've been to Forefather's Cemetery at night and it was a little spooky. You always wished to see what the inside of the Little Red Schoolhouse looked like. You know what 'Let the Children Guard What the Sires Have Won' is and where it can be found. You notice the difference between East Chelsmford and West Chelmsford as being like city and country. You actually enjoy driving around rotaries. You look in all possible directions when you're driving through Chicken Corner. You go to the neighboring towns to see their Christmas decorations. We rather spend our budget on a first class education system. You are a member of this great group and a citizen of the greatest town in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...

It is the smallest city in Massachusetts in land area. History The area was first called Winnisimmet. meaning 'good spring nearby.' by the Massachusett tribe which once lived here. It was settled in 1624 by Samuel Maverick. whose palisaded trading post is considered the first permanent settlement at Boston Harbor. In 1635. Maverick sold all of Winnisimmet. except for his house and farm. to Richard Bellingham. The community remained part of Boston until it was set off and incorporated in 1739. when it was named after Chelsea. a neighborhood in London. In 1775. the Battle of Chelsea Creek was fought here. the second battle of the Revolution. at which American forces made one of their first captures of a British ship. Part of Washington's army was stationed here during the Siege of Boston. Chelsea originally included North Chelsea -- all of Revere. Winthrop and parts of Saugus. In 1846. North Chelsea was set off as a separate town. Reincorporated as a city in 1857. Chelsea developed as an industrial center. producing rubber and elastic goods. boots and shoes. stoves and adhesives. It became home to a naval hospital (designed by Alexander Parris) and soldiers' home. But on April 12. 1908. nearly half the city was destroyed in the First Great Chelsea Fire. In 1973. the Second Great Chelsea Fire burned 18 city blocks. In September 1991. Massachusetts enacted special legislation to place Chelsea into receivership. This was the first time since the Great Depression that a United States municipality had such an action taken against it. Events preceding the action included failed financial intervention by the state. a political stalemate over the city's budget. deepening economic decline and a spiraling fiscal crisis. Fortunately. Chelsea had no publicly held long-term debt -- thus. a solution to its problems could be explored in isolation of creditors. A charter change in 1995 designed an efficient council-manager form of government. which has focused on improving the quality of service the city provides to its residents and businesses. while establishing financial policies that have significantly improved the city's financial condition. Increased emphasis on economic development and capital improvement has led to an influx of new business and homebuyers.",NA,Chelsea,MA,Massachusetts,42.396252,-71.032521

What I’ve learned in my time as admin on this group is that it’s very important to explain from the start. that this is not a town run. owned. or operated group. This is a simple Facebook group created by one person with a vision for it which was to share memories of what it was like growing up here. or to live here now. We share things about the towns history. and current events. politics aside. It’s not a place where debates are meant to take place. It is a place for simple enjoyment of one another sharing memories and interesting facts about our town. The group has a simple design and its purposes and goals will be upheld. It is not. I repeat. a town run or administrated or governed group. It is not a politics group and how it is run is not up for vote. However. we are concerned about all of our members and their ability to enjoy their time spent here. The First and most important thing you can do as a new member is to review the rules and agree to abide by them. Welcome and enjoy. Our group is for anyone who either has or does live or work in our great little Town of Clinton MA or has strong ties here. to share memories. history. happenings. pictures. or stories about our town. These stories and sharing. should not be inflammatory. or inciting debate about laws and policies of the town specifically. Thank you. By member vote it was decided long ago that posts of a political nature will not be part of our group. While our group is not an advertising site. members who have local private businesses are welcome to post one ad per month (every 30 days). Official Nonprofits. schools. churches. libraries and community groups/programs are welcome to post one ad per week (7 days) for each event. Commenting on your post is a good way to bring attention to it or add updates/new events VS re-posting outside of these requests. Thank you. Please be sure to read through the group rules. Following them will allow you to post without prior approval from the group administrators/moderators. This group is run by a team that works together to keep the group's purposes. intentions. goals in focus as established by the founder of this group. It is NOT a town-run group. it is a personal group. created for enjoyment of its members. as seen through the vision of the cgroup creator. Rules are meant to keep focus and peace. If you have questions about what is allowed. or concerns about anything that happens in our group. please know you are welcome to come to any of the team (Admins/moderators) and we will be happy to address them for you to the best of our ability. We will not engage in arguments. so please remember when addressing concerns that how the group operates is the decision of the founder and admin team. The best interest of all of our members is always our top priority.",2 posts a day,Clinton,MA,Massachusetts,42.418147,-71.682847

Businesses can place job listings. please try to put multiples in a single post. or special events. Please try to refrain from regular ads so we don't become overwhelmed by them. but by all means special events you might be having are welcome (ie new store openings. book signings. craft activities. giveaways. etc). Post local events. fundraisers (please no Gofundme or similar pages just because there are sooooo many). programs etc. If you've been part of a class or program locally. please share your experience with it (If you didn't like it. please say why and speak kindly).

Here is a place to sell/trade/give away your things. Keep in mind that children as young as age 14 are on Facebook. so please keep things kind. clean & family-friendly. Thank you. Basic Rules: This group is for people looking for great bargains or trying to get a little cash back or things they no longer need. It’s not for businesses. so please don't post your store's inventory. If you have a home-based business making crafts. etc. please feel free to post your creations. Just like a yard sale in your neighborhood. you wouldn’t expect to see stores setting up. Thank you. Please be kind & respectful. Zero tolerance for anything less. FIRST COME FIRST SERVED RULES: “First come first served” in this group will mean 1st to ask AND make a reasonable plan/agreement. Typing the word 'interested' will not hold items until you contact to make a plan. it means you get the first chance to make that plan. please be ready to do so. You certainly can say if you need it picked up by a certain date. Please do not expect people to rush each other to your place only to find the item gone. That’s unfair. unkind and isn’t allowed here. This includes curb alerts. Please. if you MUST do this. be willing to respond to people interested in specific items and work with them to help them get it. Thank you. POSTING: You can post any of your own belongings. as long as they are legal to sell. are not store inventory. and are not related to alcohol. recreational or other drugs. medications. smoking of any substance inluding vapor. weapons of any kind. or violence. Please. no items you would use behind closed doors and wouldn’t want your kids to see. and no expired foods are allowed. If you are unsure. please send me a pm. You may post as many items as you wish. in a group post or separate. Be honest & describe fully your items. including dimensions. color. size etc. Please bump rather than repost the same items. and please bump only every 3 days. Registered 501(c)3 Public Charites and churches may post events or requests for help in this group. Please. no Gofundme or the like. as there are just too many. SAFETY Meet in a public place. be smart about it! If someone must come to your home. be sure not to be alone. NEVER post phone numbers or addresses publically. Be aware that replying on your phone means people can potentially obtain more contact info than you wish to share. Admin and any moderators are here to provide you with a fun. comfortable group & will address concerns but cannot take responsibility for where you choose to meet. any risks you may take. etc. Rules may change as necessary and we welcome and will consider suggestions of our members.

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Dedham,MA,Massachusetts,42.243685,-71.163741

This is a private Facebook group overseen by a collaborative group of moderators. Content is moderated in accordance with the page rules. and moderator consensus. This group is in no way affiliated in any official capacity with the City of Easthampton or its local government. This group welcomes and strives to represent the diverse people who live and work in Easthampton. We share information. events. and news about our charming little city. It doesn’t have to be good news. but it does have to be honest. We are good to each other in here; civility required. kindness and thoughtfulness strongly suggested. Talk to each other as you would in real life. That doesn't mean we will always agree. but it does mean we treat one another with respect. We recognize that Facebook Groups are an inherently limited medium for community discourse. We don’t see each other’s faces. we can’t hear each other speak. and it’s hard to build comfort and familiarity with each other. We expect that all members and admins will try their best to acknowledge and overcome these limitations by being patient with each other and themselves in all communication here. You're responsible for following the rules. Please go read them if you haven't. Posts and comments must be courteous and respectful. No personal attacks of any sort. to anyone. for any reason. This includes to businesses. employees. public officials. protesters. neighbors. pedestrians. motorists. etc. Criticism of a person’s actions and/or responses is allowed as long as it is done patiently and respectfully. Example of an acceptable criticism: “I disagree with your perspective on the Union Street plan for the following reasons.” An example of criticism that will be rejected and probably get you thrown out: “You’re being stupid. and I can’t believe you consider yourself a thinking adult.” Don’t say anything that you wouldn’t say to your best friend. This isn't a big ask. We're glad you're here.",1 recent anonymous post,Easthampton,MA,Massachusetts,42.264319,-72.679921

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Fall River,MA,Massachusetts,41.718221,-71.139991

"GraftonInformed2",Grafton Informed,https://www.facebook.com/groups/GraftonInformed2/,Private,2.1K,2100.0,"Welcome to Grafton Informed! This group was created to provide a free forum for the people who live. work. or own a business in Grafton to stay current with the events that could impact them. The primary purpose of this group is to share information and foster healthy discussion on important issues. regardless of whether or not those topics are made public by the town. Any event that could potentially have an impact on the town of Grafton or one of its occupants (permanent or transient) may be discussed here. Grafton is a wonderful community but as we have seen numerous times in the past. the local government and public service agencies are not always forthcoming with objective information that should be communicated to the citizens in a timely fashion. This is a place to voice those concerns. to get answers to the questions you may have. to collaborate on important issues and help spread the word. As an individual in a town of 18.000+. each one of use is a very small voice. But as an organized group that works collectively. we can make sure that every stakeholder in the town of Grafton is kept informed. Knowledge is power. and when we share knowledge in great numbers. we CAN make a difference in our community! This group relies on crowd sourcing in order to thrive. In other words. every member of this group has an equal voice here and should feel comfortable sharing their opinion or thoughts without reservation. Other Grafton groups suppress member contributions in an attempt to keep posts in a chronological order.

This site is a gift to the Holliston Community from the Salomão-Schmidt family. WHY HOLLISTON? Wonderful schools. cafés. a lake with two beaches. horse riding. farms. bike/walking path. lots of playgrounds. nature trails. amazing library system. small hometown shops. outdoor concerts in the summer. lots of family stuff. We can even have horses and chickens in our backyards because we are a farming community! A FABULOUS PLACE to raise children! (Public schools even offer FRENCH IMMERSION and MONTESSORI for FREE!)

"154944758497994",LoveforLeah,https://www.facebook.com/groups/154944758497994/,Private,1.2K,1200.0,"Updated Description: Sadly we lost Leah to relapsed medulloblastoma on February 18. 2018. We continue to post memories of Leah and use this group as a place to publicly remember her. We also write about how to navigate the unimaginable - child loss. Leah has been battling pediatric cancer since she was 4 1/2 years-old. In January of 2016. Leah was a happy. healthy. energetic girl who was enjoying pre-k. dance and gym class. cooking and art when out of the blue she started complaining of pains in her arms. In 5 days time her family’s worst nightmare came true and Leah was diagnosed with metastatic Medulloblastoma. a Pediatric brain cancer that had already spread extensively throughout her spine. She has endured multiple rounds of high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant and spent much of 2016 inpatient at Boston Children’s Hospital. She also had to endure six weeks of proton radiation to her brain and spine at Mass General Hospital. Sadly. Leah was only able to enjoy remission for three months. and her family received the news in early June that her cancer had returned. Leah’s cancer has no cure once it relapses. She had a major seizure in September which left her in the icu intubated and paralyzed on her right side and she lost the ability to speak. She slowly recovered and was on a targeted chemotherapy which stopped working in December. She was placed on a phase 1 clinical trial and on January 22 we received the news that the cancer was growing again and has spread extensively throughout her brain and spine. We are taking Leah to Augusta. Georgia for a clinical trial in hopes of extending her life. Pediatric cancer is grossly underfunded. Only 4% of federal government cancer research funding goes to study pediatric cancer. We need a cure for these poor babies. Somehow through it all Leah continues to keep a smile on her face. She loves rainbows. emojis and all things pink and purple! For those asking to donate. this is the fundraising page set up for the family: https://www.gofundme.com/medullonomore-for-leah",NA,Hopkinton,MA,Massachusetts,42.219046,-71.530178

We are a volunteer-based group of Greater Lowell community members and a chapter of Progressive Massachusetts. Vision: Points of Unity Civil Justice: Civil liberties and protection from state repression are critical for the preservation of democracy and human dignity. Economic Justice: We demand an economy that puts the rights of the people above the profits of a few. and we oppose an economy that would strengthen the rich’s power over the poor. All members of our community – undocumented and documented – must have economic dignity. Environmental Justice: The ecological crisis. and in particular global warming/climate change. is an urgent human rights challenge; how we mitigate global warming (by ending the use of fossil fuels) and adapt to it is a moral issue. and must be done with speed and equity. Peace: War is a moral abomination. and military force ought to be the last resort in international conflict – especially since militarism stifles domestic progress. Racial Justice: Racism is structural. more than a sum of individual prejudicial actions. and must be rooted out of every part of society. We are particularly focused on protecting undocumented and other vulnerable community members in Lowell and are against white supremacy. Sexuality/Gender Justice: Women and LGBTQIA+ people must have full rights. liberation. and freedom.

Please also see Facebooks guidelines on Regulated Goods: https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards#regulated-goods It’s greatly appreciated to post about your gratitude for another member’s generosity! -BE HONEST: about who you are (only personal. real profiles. please!) about the condition of an item you’re posting. about when you may be able to leave something out or pick something up. -COMMUNICATE: Please only PM people once they have confirmed it’s okay or asked you to do so. Communicate with your neighbors if your plans change in any way. Things will go much more smoothly if we respect each other’s time and reach out if plans might not work out how we had hoped. -BE GOOD TO YOUR NEIGHBORS: This is not just about good manners. although those are also important and encouraged. Please and thank you go a long way. This is a gifting group. not a political group. so let’s avoid going off-topic. but please be conscious and sensitive of the variety of experiences in our town. -STAY ON-TOPIC: Please keep all conversations and posts relevant to the group. This group is for gifting and community-building. -NO ADVERTISING: This group will welcome advice and referrals and information and other ways of helping our neighbors get what they need. PLEASE NO SELF-PROMOTION OR ADVERTISING! -KEEP CURB ALERTS TO A MINIMUM: Keep in mind this is a group whose function is to facilitate gifting. While an added benefit of gifting is the ability to de-clutter our spaces. this group is primarily for direct and proactive giving. - TAKE ONLY WHAT IS BEING GIFTED TO YOU AND TAKE THE WHOLE ITEM: Sometimes people give away multiple items and leave them out for the intended recipients to pick up at their convenience. If you are picking up an item take only the item that is designated as being gifted to you. Do not take any other items from the gifter's property. including items marked for someone else. If you arrange to pick up an item take the whole item. do not just take the parts that you want and leave the rest. For example if there is a bureau being offered take the whole bureau not just the drawer pulls that you want. One of the intentions of this group is to keep things out of the trash. If you strip a useful item for parts you've turned that item into trash that the gifter then has to dispose of.

NO BUSINESS POSTS NO REAL ESTATE ADS NO AUTO DEALERSHIP POSTS You are welcome to post pics of items to sell but always add a description. how much you are asking for. and location. Asking price & location must be in the post. Posts such as best offer takes it. PM with offer. etc are not allowed. If item is cross posted please state that. Absolutely NO animal sales of any kind. This is not an auction site. You cannot have bidding wars for an item. The first person who posts interested first gets the item. if they pass you move onto the next person in line and so on. Please post interested on the post before sending a PM so there is an accurate time record for the seller to know who was first and for us to access if there is any issues. If a post is up and you are interested. write interested. If others posted interested before you. they get first 'dibs' down the line in order of interest. DO NOT offer more money on the post or through private message or say i can pick up right now/ asap trying to get the seller to skip everyone to give item to you. If you buy an item/ receive it for free and decide you do not need it. you may re-post it. Post it for the same price you paid for it. Ex: if you buy an item for $20 please resell for $20 or less. Free= Free etc. We do not condone someone buying or receiving items for free to make money. If you are caught/ suspected of flipping items for a profit. you will be messaged and/or banned from the site. Originally it was asked that you wait 24 hrs. for the first person to respond to your post to say if they indeed wanted it but it is a long time. some people do have jobs and are not at their computers 24/7. Please use your good judgement/ common sense & give the person to the end of the day when they could be out of work/ home before moving onto the next person. So that someone doesn't get passed. when you say interested. say that you may be away from computer for X amount of time or check in periodically as the item may be passed onto you. Please try not to tie up an item. Please delete post after items have sold! If you don't know how. post 'sold' on the post so we can delete it. If it is an album of items. write 'sold dresser. all others still avail' so everyone knows what has sold & what hasn't. Also so we don't delete your album. NO selling knock off items. Please wait 24 hrs. before bumping. We are not held responsible for items sold here. Use your own discretion when buying an item from someone. 'Buyer Beware'. ALL sales are final.. So check the item BEFORE money is exchanged. Do not harass/threaten other members. No name bashing. Any questions contact Tina Lawrence.

Veteran Sarah O'Hearn. who ultimately lost her battle with SUD. (Substance Use Disorder). The purpose of this group is to provide support to those who are affected by SUD or families of those affected by SUD. The admins work behind the scenes. with people to help find beds for treatment. People are urged to pm one of the admins if they require assistance. Lists of available beds are posted daily as a tool to aid the search. There are other means to find available resources. Right now we are providing that information on an as needed basis. Our goal. going forward. is to have all of the files updated so that anyone seeking assistance will be able to do so just by accessing the files. We will never deny assistance. but in doing this. it frees us up to work more on advocacy and become more pro-active in the fight against SUD. As things happen. we will update everyone. as things will be rolling out at different times. As you know. all posts are reviewed by admins prior to posting to the page. Moving forward. we will be taking the extra step to make sure duplicate posts are not posted to the page. in order to prevent the page from being flooded with the same thing multiple times. If you post to the page and are concerned that it wasn't posted. this may be the reason. WE ARE HERE FOR YOU!!! :-)",NA,Marshfield,MA,Massachusetts,42.106177,-70.69931

Both parties should PM in a timely manner to arrange for a pickup time and location. Be timely and respectful in regards to picking up items. Most items are picked up that day or the next day. Longer pickup windows are fine if both parties agree. Please report people who do not pick up items to the administrators. A pattern of not picking up items can result in removal from the group.

Use your discretion in posting news involving on-going police investigations. local accidents or school incidents. We have incredibly qualified and thoughtful professional leaders at our police and fire departments. town offices. and school district. They are the best authorities to disseminate such news to the public. Once they have done so. by all means feel free to copy their messages or links to anything they have posted for the public here. 5. Negative reviews of local businesses are prohibited. Such posts and comments can be destructive to those trying to make a living in our community and it is impossible for administrators to verify the veracity of such comments. Again. you are free to voice your opinion on your personal page. 6. When annoyed. consider moving on without commenting or attacking the source of your annoyance and when in doubt about what to write. err on the side of kindness. You'll never regret doing so. 7. Don't make any comment to someone that you wouldn't say to them if you were standing in line next to them at the Muffin House with your kids watching. Which brings me to the next rule... 8.

'rehomed'. or deleted so they will be aware when an item is no longer available.

The town was named after Sir John Monson. a friend of the governor.[1] Monson was largely a mill town until most of the mills in town closed down due to poor business. Monson also had a large granite quarry that was opened by Rufus Flynt. later owned by his oldest son William Flynt. It was closed around 1935.

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,New Bedford,MA,Massachusetts,41.634749,-70.9372

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either.

Reading and surrounding town residents who oppose development of a massive apartment complex in a quiet residential area adjacent to wetlands and the Ipswich river. Nick Yebba. Sr. owner of Theresa's Prime has filed a development proposal under Mass 40B to build 200 units for rent on the Theresa's Prime/Resorts North location. Everyone in North Reading stands to be impacted by this development. Taxes. Schools. Traffic. Town resources. etc. None of these concerns will prevent the development from happening. What can potentially halt this project is the impact it will have on our water source and conservation of the Ipswich River since the proposed location is right on the Ipswich river. North Reading residents aren't the only ones being affected. Lynnfield residents will be impacted as well. because they draw their water supply from the Ipswich River. West Peabody and Middleton. as well as Lynnfield will be effected because the proposed development site is located near the town lines. Let's work together to strategize ways to stop this proposal from getting approved as it currently stands. Though Yebba is within his right to propose his property in this way. he has shown a complete disregard for conservation of the Ipswich river. the surrounding quiet neighborhoods. the town and residents that have all welcomed him and supported his restaurants. Please share this group with others and alert as many people as possible of this. Please plan to attend as many public meetings as possible. Again. we all stand to be impacted here.

The western half became part of Rhode Island; this portion is now East Providence and Seekonk area. Rumford has previously been part of three towns and two states; Rehoboth. Massachusetts. Seekonk.

Massachusetts. The neighborhood is located on a peninsula surrounded by Town River Bay on the west and Rock Island Cove on the east. This peninsula was known since the 1640s as “Shed's Neck”. Palmer Street. the main thoroughfare of the neighborhood. was named for General Joseph Palmer. In 1752 Palmer and Richard Cranch. brother in law of John Adams and father of American jurist William Cranch. were held by tenure of lease by a company interested in German immigration to create a planned manufacturing community. The land was to be settled in the 1750s by a group of glassmakers and weavers from Germany. The planned community was a failure by 1760. but the name has remained since that time. By the late 18th century. ship building became the major industry because of the ideal location of the neighborhood. In 1861. ferry service was established between Germantown and Quincy Point. The tallest building in the neighborhood is the seven-story O'Brien Towers. Most children in Germantown go to Snug Harbor for elementary school. Broad Meadows for middle school. and Quincy High for high school. Snug Harbor is the only school physically within the neighborhood. The neighborhood has a small general store (Palmer Street Store. also known as the blue store...LESTER'S!!!). In 2007. the city opened the Germantown Neighborhood Center in the former St. Boniface Church for use in a variety of neighborhood educational and community functions. - But for those of Us that grew up there. it will always be known as G-Town.",3 posts a day,Quincy,MA,Massachusetts,42.249133,-70.997816

Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Salem,MA,Massachusetts,42.515114,-70.900343

"wearesouthwickma",You Know You're From SOUTHWICK$ MA If...,https://www.facebook.com/groups/wearesouthwickma/,Private,4.2K,4200.0,"History Southwick was originally inhabited by either the Matitacooke. Mayawaug or Woronoake Native American tribes. Early history In the mid-17th century. pioneering English explorers moving up the Connecticut River Valley seeking fertile farmlands and game discovered the area and settled Southwick. It became a farming community. defined as the Southern (South-) village (-wick) part of the town of Westfield. Massachusetts. Early on. it was nicknamed 'Poverty Plains' because the land was thought to be infertile. Its first residential home was built by Samuel Fowler and his wife Naomi Noble on what is now College Highway (US 202 and MA 10). about a quarter-mile north of the current town center. In colonial times. church attendance was mandatory. The 800 Christian residents of Southwick in the 1760–1770s were required to travel to Westfield to congregate. Only by establishing their own church community could they establish their own parish. as they desired. On November 7. 1770. Southwick was incorporated as a separate district of Westfield. The area of Southwick became somewhat smaller in 1770. The southernmost portion of Southwick joined Suffield. Connecticut. as the result of a simultaneous secession of citizens in that part of the village. Independence Southwick became a fully independent town in 1770. The town remained divided until 1793. when Massachusetts claimed the area (known as the 'jog'). A border dispute continued until 1804. when the current boundary was established through a compromise between Connecticut and Massachusetts. As a result of this border resolution. Southwick is the southernmost town in western Massachusetts.",NA,Southwick,MA,Massachusetts,42.051099,-72.770588

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Tewksbury,MA,Massachusetts,42.60283,-71.223224

Under the files tab you will find great resources to information about the town and under the photo's section you will find pictures from local events and other great information! Enjoy ;) Uxbridge is a town in Worcester County. Massachusetts first settled in 1662. incorporated in 1727. originally part of Suffolk County. and Mendon. and named for the Earl of Uxbridge. The town. (population 13.560. estimate 2012) is located 36 mi (58 km) southwest of Boston and 15 mi (24 km) south-southeast of Worcester. at the midpoint of the Blackstone Valley Heritage Corridor. Two Uxbridge Quakers served as national leaders in the anti-slavery movement. Uxbridge 'weaves a tapestry of early America' 'Nipmuc Praying Indians'. at 'Wacentug' (river bend). deeded land to 17th century settlers. Uxbridge granted rights to America's first woman voter. Lydia Chapin Taft. The first hospital for mental illness in America was established here.Deborah Sampson posed as an Uxbridge soldier. and fought in the American Revolution. A 140 year legacy of manufacturing military uniforms and clothing began with 1820 power looms. The Board of Selectmen approved Massachusetts's first women jurors. Uxbridge became famous for woolen cashmeres. 'Uxbridge Blue'. was the first US Air Force Dress Uniform.BJ's Wholesale Club distribution warehouse looms large here today. As Uxbridge approaches its 300th year. its 14.000 residents share a proud history. a good quality of life. and a profound natural beauty in the heart of the Blackstone River Valley Heritage National Park. Our traditions. as a farming and mill community. are expanding into a growing and popular recreation area. Boating. kayaking. and fishing are now enhanced by two significant rail trail hiking and biking venues. The Southern New England Trunkline Trail links communities from the Connecticut border to Franklin. New sections opened this year of the 48 mile Blackstone River Bikeway that runs from Providence to Worcester. With the completion of the Route 146 highway connections with Providence. Worcester. and the Mass Pike. and our proximity to a nationally important dense fiber data connection corridor. Uxbridge is well placed for future growth. Uxbridge’s natural resources include a high-yield aquifer of regional significance. It is home to more than a dozen working farms. a growing advanced manufacturing cluster. and an expanding base of high tech firms.",6 posts a day,Uxbridge,MA,Massachusetts,42.074426,-71.632869

PI was founded by William Hawkes. publisher of Child Life magazine. and designed by Cornelius Vanderbilt Wood. a designer of Disneyland and Lake Havasu City. Covering 80 acres (320.000 m). the park featured a plethora of rides and other attractions. including the Space Rocket ride. the Pirate Ride. the Moby-Dick ride (which featured a spouting mechanical whale rising from the depths). the Wreck of the Hesperus (dark ride). the Old Chisholm Trail (dark ride). theme restaurants. a shopping area. an arcade. mini-golf (from 1967). a carousel. Monkey Island. and many others. Actors would stage mock gunfights in the Western City or threaten to attack riders on the boat rides. The park's Old Smokey Railroad Line was a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railroad using equipment leased from the Edaville Railroad. Another park feature was the Show Bowl. where performers such as Ricky Nelson. Michael Landon. The Modernaires. the Three Stooges. Clayton Moore. Don Ameche. and Cesar Romero appeared. Product placement and branding played a part in some attractions. such as the Grist Mill which featured Pepperidge Farm products and the Pepsi-Cola Diamond Lil Theater. Its cartoon character mascot for a time was Popeye. Today. the land formerly occupied by the park is now Private Property Edgewater Office Park. *This page is in no way affiliated or any connection to the Robert McLaughlin Pleasure Island Books. nor do we support or allow anything from said books on this page.

Buzzards Bay and Onset. I feel privileged that I have the opportunity to travel down the lovely stretch of 6-28. as it winds it's was through Wareham. Nothing beats a pond that regularly forms in the middle of a highway. every time it rains and especially when you're late for work. The journey that lead to the creation of this page. started when I was summarily removed from the 'other' Wareham Matters Page. apparently for a bit too much tomfoolery and ballyhoo. After being kicked out of Wareham Matters (unofficial). I wandered the streets aimlessly and wept for many hours. eventually crying myself to sleep. After many months of counseling and cognitive therapy. I decided that the only way to move on was to create the 'official' page of Wareham. where everyone can just have fun and maybe get along...or not. The healing process begins here.

Leah has been battling pediatric cancer since she was 4 1/2 years-old. In January of 2016. Leah was a happy. healthy. energetic girl who was enjoying pre-k. dance and gym class. cooking and art when out of the blue she started complaining of pains in her arms. In 5 days time her family’s worst nightmare came true and Leah was diagnosed with metastatic Medulloblastoma. a Pediatric brain cancer that had already spread extensively throughout her spine. She has endured multiple rounds of high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant and spent much of 2016 inpatient at Boston Children’s Hospital. She also had to endure six weeks of proton radiation to her brain and spine at Mass General Hospital. Sadly. Leah was only able to enjoy remission for three months. and her family received the news in early June that her cancer had returned. Leah’s cancer has no cure once it relapses. She had a major seizure in September which left her in the icu intubated and paralyzed on her right side and she lost the ability to speak. She slowly recovered and was on a targeted chemotherapy which stopped working in December. She was placed on a phase 1 clinical trial and on January 22 we received the news that the cancer was growing again and has spread extensively throughout her brain and spine. We are taking Leah to Augusta. Georgia for a clinical trial in hopes of extending her life. Pediatric cancer is grossly underfunded. Only 4% of federal government cancer research funding goes to study pediatric cancer. We need a cure for these poor babies. Somehow through it all Leah continues to keep a smile on her face. She loves rainbows. emojis and all things pink and purple!

Your business must be in Worcester County. Not a business from outside Worcester county that does business here in Worcester County. Not a person who lives outside of Worcester County who works from home and says they 'work in Worcester County.' Not a business who's shop is located out of Worcester County Massachusetts but travels to Worcester County Massachusetts. Not Worcester County in England. Our goal is that people who are self employed will be able to advertise on this site so others will be able to see the wonderful services that we provide and will be able to connect with each one of us to help our business's. Networking with other business's is a great way to get to know one another and be able to utilize other's services. Worcester County Networking. its managers. agents or other representatives of this site accept no liability for the content of this site. as always - buyer beware. There are SEVERAL fb groups who do advertisement. WE are not the last chance corral. Rules : 1) With over 800 people in the group. there are bound to be disagreements. Please take those disagreements to a personal message so the other folks in the group do not have to be subject to arguments. Please respect each other and the group. 2) If you started with the group with a particular field but now wish to advertise something completely different. please ask Admin first. Some groups are closed and therefore you would be asked to wait until space frees up. 3) Always remember that there are usually more than just one member from a particular field and therefore give others from that field time to post. At this point lets try to limit posting from any one business (not field) once per day. 4) If you would like to do a post that has nothing to do with your field please check with admin first. We want to maintain the focus of our group. 5) If Admin finds that a particular field is not being represented - new members of that field will be accepted. 6) In our group we want 'active' members. We want to know who you are and what service you provide. The definition of 'active' in our group is to post at least weekly and no more than once per day for each business you have been approved to advertise. We have built an amazing group where we want everyone to know your name so please don't' be shy. Get involved in the group by supporting others business's and asking questions. Non active members run the risk of being deleted if some one else wants to advertise in this group in your field. We have several requests to join each day. 7) admin reserves the right to add new rules or change pre-existing ones. 8) Remember there is no test or back ground check to be a member. Always ask for proof of insurance and identity. Buyer beware. 9) Have fun",NA,Worcester,MA,Massachusetts,42.2621,-71.8034

We are a Fellowship that comes together. eat together. who share one's interests. and making contact with Live video streams. This fellowship follows the work of Dr. Steven Greer who has taught us all to make peaceful ET Contact. We get together on a monthly basis to participate in fellowship CE5 Meditations. Every month we meet in a different location in Massachusetts/New Hampshire. Rhode Island and we follow the CE5 protocol through meditation and try to initiate peaceful contact with our seen and unseen family from Space. We are all on the same or different journey. though we may have different avenues to get there. That is okay! We are all at different levels but we learn from each other and help each other progress on our spiritual journeys. Each family member of the group has a special something they have a passion for that they can offer to the group. You will see through discussions and posts that we are all trying to raise our vibrations. develop our light bodies and help anchor 5th dimensional light onto the planet to help Gaia make the transition to the 5th dimension. We celebrate our differences and show a mutual respect for all. If you do see a post/article that you like. please give it a 'Like. Love. or Comment' so that we can continue to support one another and grow from everyone's input. We can all learn so much from each other. Forgiveness is important as I have forgiven those who hurt me in the past and have moved forward but even though they are still trying to hurt me. I love them all so much and bless them with great energy. love. happiness and that they will all flourish as well. There is no room for hate nor grudges nor past tensions but only ever lasting love. peace. and happiness for all. We encourage our family members to stay away from things that lower our vibrations and calcify our pineal glands. We understand that we are all human and we all have our attachments to certain things. so this is just encouraged and not required. The only thing we ask is that during the day of our CE5 gatherings. family members who are planning to participate please stay away from things like Alcohol. Cigarettes. Drugs and Marijuana. In order for our CE5 meditations to be successful and make peaceful contact with our space families we need to keep our vibrations as high as possible. Our families from space will only join us if our fellowship vibrations are as close to the same frequency as theirs. We do not believe in voting anyone out either. Space from each other is great and when time passes by both parties will heal on its own and come together again as family.",NA,Worcester,MA,Massachusetts,42.2621,-71.8034

Donate things that other people need. or just give away the things you don't need any longer. to keep our landfills clean. No Spamming allowed! This Group is ONLY for Residences of Norfolk Ma and Wrentham Ma Please DELETE your post after the item has been picked up or you've received what you are looking for to keep the feed clean. 1. ***I would prefer that EVERY post start with ISO. WANTED. or OFFER. It is sometimes difficult to understand what someone is doing when these words are omitted. 2. ***If you see something you want. mark the post with 'INTERESTED' in the comments and then PM the person with a day and time you think you can come. FIRST PERSON TO COMMENT INTERESTED. IS FIRST IN LINE. NO EXCEPTIONS; However. if the person cannot make arrangements within an acceptable time frame for the person offering the item – they can reserve the right to say – sorry. I need to move on. It is the givers discretion how quickly they need an item picked up. It is absolutely ok to say “I need this gone today” Or “preference to fastest pickup”. 3. ***Cross Posting***To Be fair to ALL members. if you are X - Posting your item on another site. please put this in your post. 4. ***If your ISO posts have been inactive for over 30 days. we can only assume you either received the item or forgot about it. Hopefully you received it. Either way it will be removed to keep the feed clean. 5. ***IF YOU MAKE A COMMITTMENT AND CANNOT KEEP IT – YOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFIY THE OTHER PARTY! REPEAT OFFENDERS OF BEING “NO SHOWS” WILL BE BANNED. Life is life and unexpected stuff happens – but we will not tolerate continual disrespect and rudeness here. Being a no show is both of those things. If you notify someone that you are no longer going to be able to take the item and can't keep the commitment – this is NOT a no show. A no show is someone who states a date and time and does not tell you they are not coming. If you have to skip out on meeting someone make every attempt to let them know. If you cannot reach them. post in the group and tag them with the time you were supposed to meet them so we can see that an attempt was made at a reasonable time before the meet up. 6. ***It is absolutely NOT ok to pick up items with the intention of resale*** If you are found to be doing this. – you will be removed and banned. The EXCEPTION to this is if you are a “scrap metaler” (you provide the community a great service in taking this stuff off our hands) 7. ***NO SPAM or phishing posts. they will be deleted immediately and the user blocked from the group. 8. ***NO LINKS to groups or donation without explicit permission from an Admin.
